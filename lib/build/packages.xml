		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Ash is a high-performance entity system framework for game development
with Adobe Flash and Adobe Air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An entity system is a way to organise the code for a game that is efficient for both code execution 
and code management. It uses composition rather than inheritance for sharing features between game objects and 
uses a data-oriented approach to separate the game state from the game logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ash is a small library that provides the core classes that you need to create your game with this more 
productive and performant architecture. Ash is designed specifically for games, focusing on the features of games 
that make them hard to manage and simplifying them. The entity system architecture used in Ash is explained 
&lt;a href="http://www.ashframework.org" target="top"&gt;on the Ash website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
